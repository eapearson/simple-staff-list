A simple plugin to build and display a staff listing for your website.

== Description ==

The Simple Staff List plugin allows you to build a staff directory for your website. You get an easy-to-use interface
which allows you to edit the following fields for each staff member: Name, Photo, Position, Email, Phone Number, and Bio.
There's also a drag-and-drop interface to set the order of your staff members.

You'll use the `[simple-staff-list]` shortcode within a page or post to display the full staff listing in the order set
on the "Order" page. You'll be able to customize the information shown for each staff member on your website by editing a simple template. You can add your own custom CSS to style your staff list as well.
